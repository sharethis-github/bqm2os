# git revert may not play well with replaying table loads

# allow for specifying arbirary template k/v from command line or a file

# cancel running jobs whose local definitions or upstream dependencies have changed

# need to parse unmanaged dependencies as well as managed tependencies
# add exponential back off for failed jobs

# re-execute - DONE
- when file definition is newer than created table
- when any table I directly depend on is newer than my table

# add ability to toggle execute legacy or ansi - DONE - can use the # directives
# expose all or most flags needed for query execution and saving query results

# allow static table dependencies

# allow for dag creation within airflow

# allow for backfilling of tables

# allow date templatized table names

# maintain state via job queue
   # when I find that I need to create a table then I need to check
   # that there isn't a running job which is already doing that
   # I could look for job ids of a particular format or I could just
   # build a map of destination tables from job meta data

# add a web app which shows state of jobs executing

# support generating independ

# support tables refering to themselves but only tables that refer to older tables
    - way to do this is ensure that tables exist oldest to youngest

# generate dynamically dependency on dataset existing - maybe.  actually pretty small ask
to require a dataset file also paves the way for add attributes to that dataset

# the cmd line bq load command has some ability to dynamically detect schema.  we may want to 
try to use that in the api


# integration tests
1. test table create when does not exist
   when overwritings
    when overwriting and changing schema
